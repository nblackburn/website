# Hi, i'm Nathaniel ðŸ‘‹

My story is a little different from the usual, as I am self-taught.
You see, I have always had a love for computers. I started at 13
years old making little tools for people.

Being a developer is not easy, especially when you are self-taught.
I have faced so much rejection that it no longer affects me. But
here's the thing. You have to keep going and use it as a driving
force. I wanted to be here enough that I kept on fighting.

My aim is simple, I love making people happy in any way I can. This
website is one of reflection to share some of those things I have
worked on in the hope that they can reach others.

Have a look around, stay a while, or [reach out](/contact). I would love
to hear from you.
